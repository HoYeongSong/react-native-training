# Install react-native

#### Install Node.js
React-Native requires [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](npmjs.com) installed in your machine.
It's recommeneded to use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install both `node` and `npm`.

```sh
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

Check nvm version by running
```
$ nvm --version
```

You can now install `nodejs` and `npm` via `nvm`.
```
// This will install latest version of node version 10 which is 10.14.2 currently.
$ nvm install 10

// Below command will set default node version for nvm
$ nvm alias default 10.14.2
```

Now check `nodejs` and `npm` version.
```
$ node -v
10.14.2
$ npm -v
6.4.1
```
